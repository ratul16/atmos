# Atmos

Atmos is a weather app made with vue js. You can search weather information by city name. It will information such as current Weather status, Temperature, Min - Max Temperature, Pressure , Wind Speed, Humidity, Cloud percentage, Geo Coords, Country Code And also depending on the Temperature the wallpaper will change for show a summer or a winter image. [Openweather](https://openweathermap.org/) API was used for the weather data. Soon I will be adding daily weather graph to this webapp
